# Contributing
There are two ways to contribute to this repository, you can improve the docs or
the code surrounding this project.

## API docs
The BOM api is under constant development. This means there will be new endpoints
popping up or changes to the way that requests work. If you find something new
or an error, please feel free to edit the docs file and send a pull request. The
docs are written in markdown. If you need to learn it there are resources available
[here](https://www.markdownguide.org/). If you can't figure something out, you can
submit a partial pull request and then I will complete it for you.

If you find something but don't have the time to fix it, please file a [bug](https://github.com/trickypr/bom-weather-docs/issues) or create a [discussion](https://github.com/trickypr/bom-weather-docs/discussions) thread.

## Associated code
All of the code for this repo is written in typescript and should be labeled well
enough. Please feel free to create pull requests. If you don't understand something
or need help with the code, please create a [discussion](https://github.com/trickypr/bom-weather-docs/discussions) thread.
